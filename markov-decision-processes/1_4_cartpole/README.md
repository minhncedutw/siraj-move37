# 1.4: Cartpole

> For this first week, the homework assignment is to install and run a virtual game environment using the OpenAI Gym python library

> After installing OpenAI Gym, have the ‘cartpole’ environment play out on your screen so that you can visualize it. Then, copy the 2 first techniques used in this blog post in your local environment (skip the last policy gradients one, we’ll cover that later on in the course). Observe and analyze how both strategies work differently.

## Usage

To solve Cartpole problem by 1st method Random Search, type in terminal: `python 01-cartpole-random-search.py`
To solve Cartpole problem by 2nd method Hill-climbing, type in terminal: `python 02-cartpole-hill.py`
To solve Cartpole problem by 3rd method Policy Gradient, type in terminal: `python 03-cartpole-policy-gradient.py`
