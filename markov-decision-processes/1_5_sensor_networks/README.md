# 1.5: Sensor Networks

> We can imagine sensors as a grid, then use the bellman equation to compute the optimal policy to get from Router A to Router B as efficinetly as possible. Implementations of MDP value iteration, MDP policy iteration, and Q-Learning in a toy grid-world setting.

## Usage

Type in terminal to run the code: `python RL.py`
